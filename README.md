# recycling-project

This project is created with php and sql, the purpose of it is to show recycling in my city.
I created two tables in a mysql database, then exported in the 2 files .sql contained in the migrations folder.
I used an apiRest to make a connection with the database, the tables are encoded into 2 json files contained in the json folder, 
the data are represented in arrays.
<h3>structure</h3>

There are 4 folders and 3 separated files:
<ol>
<li>configuration: contains the file to connect with the database.</li>
<li>json: contains 2 files with the data of the tables encoded in json.</li>
<li>migrations: there are the 2 sql files</li>
<li>models: there are 2 files in which are declared and selected all the elements contained in the tables.</li>
</ol>

The other 3 files show the data whith arrays.
